/**
 * @class AcBatchCollector
 * @brief One datastream's autocorrelation-batch collector for fxcorr-xp --
 *        the in-memory form of fxcorr-f's
 *        FEngineWriter::writeAutocorrelationBatch.
 *
 * The station stage calls collect() at every maxacblocks boundary of the
 * subint (and once for the trailing partial batch); Integrator::addAutocorrs
 * accumulates the returned records.  The channel counts and the
 * zoom-to-parent weight mapping are precomputed exactly like
 * FEngineWriter's constructor, and collect() follows the same steps as
 * writeAutocorrelationBatch: averageFrequency(), then the parallel section
 * and -- when WRITE AUTOCORRS && maxproducts > 2 -- the cross-pol section,
 * both walked in total-band order with zoom band weights taken from the
 * parent recorded band (core.cpp:1324-1339).
