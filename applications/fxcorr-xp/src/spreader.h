/**
 * @class SpReader
 * @brief The spectrum-source interface XmacEngine reads from (fxcorr-xp).
 *
 * fxcorr-x's SpReader read one band_XX.sp file per (datastream, band).  In
 * the v9 chain the spectra never reach a file: fxcorr-xp computes them itself
 * through Mode::process and MemReader hands the engine the per-subint slots
 * straight out of the Mode (fxcorr/v9-plan.md D9).  Only the three methods
 * XmacEngine actually calls are part of the interface, so xmac.cpp is
 * unchanged from fxcorr-x.
 *
 * One instance per (datastream, band) in datastream-total band order, the
 * same indexing fxcorr-x used: recorded bands carry their own spectra and
 * zoom bands are the parent recorded band's slice (inside Mode,
 * fftoutputs[zoom] already points into the parent array).
