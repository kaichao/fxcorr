 *
 * Subint results are accumulated with Visibility::addData(); when an
 * integration period completes, writedata() emits the SWIN record and
 * increment() moves the Visibility to the next period.  Autocorrelations
 * arrive in memory from fxcorr-xp's own station stage (v9: autocorr.bin no
 * longer exists, fxcorr/v9-plan.md D7).
 *
 * When a monitor is attached, each completed integration also emits a
 * DIFX_STATE_RUNNING DifxMessage (algo-plan.md P1, upstream
 * Visibility::multicastweights visibility.cpp:1100-1146).
