/**
 * @class PcalTextWriter
 * @brief Appends intTime-averaged phasecal tones to the experiment-level text
 *        file <pcaldir>/PCAL_<mjd>_<sec>_<station> (pcaldir = vis/<exp>.difx/,
 *        .input OUTPUT FILENAME), byte-compatible with mpifxcorr's
 *        Visibility::writeSWIN pcal section (visibility.cpp:989-1051) and
 *        header (visibility.cpp:107-136).  See algo-plan.md P0.
 *
 * One file per station, shared by that station's datastreams (upstream
 * visibility.cpp:120-122); the datastream is carried by the 4th field of each
 * data line, so jobs writing the same station never clash as long as they
 * only ever replace their own (datastream, timestamp) line.
 *
 * Per-subint tones (Mode::getPcal after finalisepcal) are accumulated in
 * subint order -- same summation order as Core::copyPCalTones
 * (core.cpp:1131-1153), so the f32 results are bit-identical to upstream.
 * Every intTime boundary the accumulated line is appended idempotently:
 * the previous line for this datastream at this timestamp is dropped while
 * every other line (other intTimes, other batches, sibling datastreams) is
 * kept, so rerunning a batch does not duplicate lines.
